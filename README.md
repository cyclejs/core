> Cycle.js is a fully reactive JavaScript framework for Human-Computer Interaction.

In the present, many frameworks have an implicit data flow, meaning that following the flow of data can become a headache. On the contrary, **Cycle.js** made this problem dissapear. The flow of data is clear by reading your code.

No side effects, why?! Functional and reactive. **Cycle.js** apps are made of pure functions which take inputs and generate outputs, with no side effects.

This are some of the benefits that **Cycle.js** provide for your app. Learn more, [here](http://cycle.js.org/).


Cycle *Core* is the minimum required tools you need for building applications. It is comprised of one single function, `Cycle.run(main, drivers)`.

## Installing

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40cycle%2Fcore.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/%40cycle%2Fcore)

`npm install rx @cycle/core`

Note: `rx` is a **required** dependency. Without it, nothing will change.
